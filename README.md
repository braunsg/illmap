# illmap
These scripts provide a template describing how to make an animated map in D3.js that shows interlibrary loan transactions into and out of a university library. One script is for automatic geocoding of institutions, the other for the design of the map itself.

The project originated as part of [DASH] (http://z.umn.edu/dash "DASH") (Digital Arts Sciences + Humanities) at the University of Minnesota Libraries. 

An [example] (http://z.umn.edu/illmap "example") with deidentified and geolocated University of Minnesota Libraries interlibrary loan data. 

Script writtens by Steven Braun (sbraun@umn.edu), Informatics/Data Services Specialist, University of Minnesota Libraries and Kevin Dyke (kevindyke@umn.edu), Spatial Data Analayst, University of Minnesota Libraries.
